I have written the script in Python. There are 3 funcions min_and_max_length, pass_atleast_one_character, pass_cannot_contain.
These are the functions that were instructed to apply in our assignment. The user has to input comma seperated values in these values first the spaces are stripped and then passed into all the functions and gives the output accordingly.
